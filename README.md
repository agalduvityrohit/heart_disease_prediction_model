# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project builds a **complete machine learning system** to predict whether a person is likely to have **heart disease**, based on medical attributes.  
It uses the famous **Heart Disease Dataset** (commonly used in Kaggle and UCI ML repositories).

The project includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing & scaling
- Training two ML models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report
- ROC curve comparison (AUC score)
- Feature importance ranking
- Single patient risk prediction
